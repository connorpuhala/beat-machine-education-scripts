    "artist_bio": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The group consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They are widely regarded as the most influential band in the history of popular music.\n\nThe Beatles revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often at the forefront of cultural movements during the 1960s. Their innovative approach to songwriting, recording techniques, and album production set new standards that continue to influence musicians today.\n\nBy 1969, when \"Come Together\" was released, The Beatles were at their creative peak while simultaneously dealing with internal tensions that would eventually lead to their breakup in 1970. Despite these challenges, they continued to produce groundbreaking music that pushed the boundaries of rock and pop.",
    "song_context": "\"Come Together\" is the opening track on The Beatles' iconic 1969 album \\textit{Abbey Road}, their penultimate studio album. Written primarily by John Lennon, the song was originally conceived as a campaign song for Timothy Leary's California gubernatorial run against Ronald Reagan in 1969.\n\nThe song features one of the most recognizable basslines in rock history, played by Paul McCartney. The groove is built on a swampy, bluesy feel that was somewhat unusual for The Beatles at the time. The cryptic lyrics reference each member of the band in abstract ways, with lines like \"He got toe jam football\" and \"He wear no shoeshine.\"\n\n\\textbf{Cultural Impact:} \"Come Together\" became a Top 10 hit and has been covered by countless artists across multiple genres. Its infectious groove and mysterious lyrics have made it a staple of classic rock radio and a favorite for musicians to reinterpret.\n\n\\textbf{Production Notes:} The track showcases the production genius of The Beatles and George Martin. The distinctive electric piano sound, the tight drums, and the prominent bass create a minimalist but powerful sonic landscape. The \"shoot me\" backing vocals add to the song's mystique.",
